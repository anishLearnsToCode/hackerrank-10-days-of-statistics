# Contributing Guidelines

This project aims to create a common source from all 30 Days of Code questions on HackerRank and values every single 
contribution made by the community.

We aim to solve all questions in the HackerRank 30 Days of Code tutorial in as many languages as possible to show the 
different code styles and approaches that can be used to solve the same problem.
 
Contributing is very simple, simply identify a question from the [README](README.md) file that has yet to be solved in
a programming language of your choice. 

Solve that question and make sure that all tests pass on HackerRank and then create a pull request with the 
added solution and updated readme.
  
## Pull Request Process

1. Fork this repository to your github account and then clone your forked repository to your machine.
2. Say you solve some problem called __Day 0: Weighted Mean__ on 
    HackerRank using your favorite programming language, say Python then simple add a new file called 
    `day_0.py` in the `python/` directory. 
3. In the [README](README.md) file, add a Python logo along with an file link.

## Programming Language Logos
To add a logo in the [README](README.md) table simply add a link with an embedded picture as 
```markdown
[![Python](icon-link)](python/day_0.py)
```

For the icon link refer to the table below to obtain the link for a specific programming language:
